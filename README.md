# arduino-pomodoro
Pomodoro app made with an LCD1602 module, a passive buzzer and 3 buttons for the Arduino Uno.
## Details
The app is composed of states. Using three buttons (left, center, right) you can manuver through the flow of the states. The app supports custom study time input and it repeats until you decide to power off the board.

I also make use of the passive buzzer by emitting an alarm tone when a session is complete. Pixel art icons have been added to add some personality to the UI.
##  Materials needed:
- One LCD1602 module;
- 3 buttons;
- One 10k Ohm potentiometer;
- (Optional) 2 220 Ohm resistors to reduce the god-awful sound of the buzzer;
- A passive buzzer;
- 2 Male-Female cables;
- A hefty amount of Male-Male cables (I counted 25);
- An Arduino Uno compatible board (mine was from Plusivo).
